# FirstPlugin
My first blank spigot plugin! It just tells you when its on and off. I followed the guide on spigotmc.org on how to create a blank spigot plugin with IntelliJ IDEA.

It says "onEnable is called!" on StartUp and "onDisable is called!" on Shutdown of the Spigot Minecraft Server. It is for 1.16, but I could theoretically change it to any version.
